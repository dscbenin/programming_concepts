It has been quite educative. So far, I have had the opportunity to try out new things and the exercises have been awesome.
Are you satisfied with the learning approach?
(if not, tell us why)
yes i am.
please suggest ways for us to improve our mentorship approach
I want to suggest that the track leaders personally monitor the progress of those in their teams, that way no one is left behind.
would you honestly say you have learnt anything so far?
yes, a lot.
do you know your Core_Team Members?
Not really
Are they supportive enough?
