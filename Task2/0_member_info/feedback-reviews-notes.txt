The task was cool...Going through the building blocks of programming with a "soft" language like python..I think the name for the bank app should have been "transaction program" or better still "simple transaction program" to prevent "big ideas"...I myself was greatly astonished until I carefully read the breakdown..Not so many would get convinced even after reading the breakdown you know....Thanks to you my bosses...You da best!!!..Thumbs up icon(notepad won't let me you know)....Once again thanks to YOU my ogas at the top!!!!!!!!!!
