Tell us what you think of the tasks so far
Task 1 was great as it focused on an indispensable tool which we will need in the future as coders in a team!! Task 2 was also cool...Going through the building blocks of programming with a "soft" language like python..I think the name for the bank app should have been "transaction program" or better still "simple transaction program" to prevent "big ideas"...I myself was greatly astonished until I carefully read the breakdown.Thanks to you guyzz...You da best!!!..Thumbs up icon(notepad won't let me you know)....Once again thanks to YOU my ogas at the top!!!!!!!!!!

Are you satisfied with the learning approach?
Learning approach?It's cool in the sense that we own our learning..More like ...no restriction..I believe that self taught tech guys are usually the best.

Please suggest ways for us to improve our mentorship approach
 I think the things to learn should be broken down or spaced a bit at least for now..After we the beginners get familiar with the pattern, I think the rushing can then begin....Not only learning time is considered ...but the time to figure out what one really needs must also be taken into consideration.


Would you honestly say you have learnt anything so far?
Hell yeah...Version control with git..Modulus operator in python to check for nigerian currency...Data structure..list..Cool man.

Are they supportive enough?
(if not, tell us what kind of improvements you want)
Supportive??...Yeah they are...........for now.
