Are you satisfied with the learning approach?
(if not, tell us why)

Yeah, programming is challenging, so this learning method helps us think outside the box.

please suggest ways for us to improve our mentorship approach
I'm okay with it, so nothing to say for now.

would you honestly say you have learnt anything so far?

yes, a whole lot.

No, I don't

Are they supportive enough?

I've not really met any so I can't say for sure.
